SHA-256 is an encryption algorithm used to encrypt information, It is one of the most secure and widely used algorithm used to encrypt information as it is impossible to decrypt because there are 2^256 possible combinations and is only a one-way encryption, making the whole process extremely fast.

It is used in back-end of various applications, especially where we need to store, parse and pass confidential information. It is also used by governments to encrypt national secrets. One of its most common applications is that it is used to encrypt passwords when being stored in a database to protect the users privacy as the password's encryption ensures that even the developer cannot access the user's secret. It allows us to send sensitive data over request easily.

We have implemented a Web app using Django which demonstrates the SHA-256 encryption algorithm in action by allowing the user to encrypt any text of their choice.
